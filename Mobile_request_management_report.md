üìë Project Report: Mobile Request & Inventory Management in ServiceNow
1. Ideation Phase
The project aims to create a Mobile Request & Inventory Management application in ServiceNow. Employees can order mobile devices through a Service Catalog item, and the IT/Mobile Management team fulfills requests using available devices from inventory.

This project demonstrates ServiceNow development best practices: users, groups, roles, ACLs, tables, UI policies, client scripts, business rules, workflows, catalog items, dashboards, App Engine Studio, and Source Control integration with GitHub.

2. Requirement Analysis
‚úÖ Request mobile devices via Service Catalog
‚úÖ Store and manage devices in a custom inventory table
‚úÖ Role-based access for end users, dispatch, and admins
‚úÖ Automate assignment of available devices
‚úÖ Provide dashboards and reports for real-time monitoring
‚úÖ Implement Business Rules to enforce logic at the database level
‚úÖ Use App Engine Studio for low-code app development
‚úÖ Connect app with GitHub (Source Control) for versioning and collaboration
3. Project Planning Phase
User & Role Management
Group Creation
Table Design (Requests & Devices)
ACL Setup
Flow Designer & Business Rules for automation
Catalog Item Creation
UI Enhancements (UI Policies, Client Scripts)
Dashboard Design
App Engine Studio for app development
GitHub for Source Control
4. Project Design Phase
Users, Groups, Roles, ACLs
Roles Created:

mobile_management - Full access to mobile request management
mobile_user - Read access to mobile devices, create requests
mobile_approver - Approval rights for mobile requests
Access Control Lists (ACLs):

Mobile device inventory access control
Request management permissions
Dashboard viewing rights
Admin function restrictions
Tables
x_888083_mobile_re_mobile_requests ‚Äì Requester, Device, Status, Delivery Date, Comments, Quantity, Total Cost

x_888083_mobile_re_mobile_devices ‚Äì Device Name, Category (iPhone/Samsung/Oppo/Vivo), Price, Description, Warranty

Business Rules
Before Insert (Mobile Requests) ‚Üí Set default status = "Requested"
After Update (Mobile Requests) ‚Üí If status = Delivered, automatically update device status
Before Delete (Mobile Devices) ‚Üí Prevent deletion if device is assigned to a user
Async Rule (Mobile Requests) ‚Üí Send notification when request is fulfilled
üìå These rules ensure data integrity, automation, and security at the server-side level.

UI Policies
Show Mobile Details Section only when device is selected
Show Delivery Details Section after device selection
Make Quantity mandatory for all requests
Auto-populate device information when selected
Client Scripts
On form load: Pre-fill Requester = logged-in user
On change of Requested Device: Auto-display device model, price, description, warranty
Dynamic section display: Show/hide sections based on form state
Workflows / Flow Designer
On catalog submission ‚Üí Create Mobile Request
If device available ‚Üí assign & mark delivered
If unavailable ‚Üí update status to On Hold
Approval workflow ‚Üí Department manager approval based on request value
Catalog Item
"Order Your Mobile" under Mobile Devices category

Variables: Device selection, quantity, department, delivery date
Auto-population: Device details based on selection
Pricing: Dynamic pricing based on device and quantity
Custom Dashboard
KPI Tiles: Total Requests, Pending, Delivered
Pie chart: Requests by Status
Bar chart: Devices by Category (iPhone, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo)
List widget: Recent Mobile Requests
Button: Request Mobile (opens catalog item)
App Engine Studio
Built tables, forms, roles, and flows directly in AES
Used low-code workspace to design app end-to-end
Application Scope: x_888083_mobile_re
Version: 1.0.0
Data Import System
Excel Data Import Process:

Import Set Table: x_888083_mobile_re_mobile_devices_import
Bulk Data Loading: Import hundreds of devices at once
Data Validation: Automatic validation during import
Error Reporting: Detailed error logs for failed imports
Audit Trail: Complete import history and tracking
Source Control (GitHub)
Linked app to GitHub repository
Used PAT authentication
Every update committed to GitHub
Repository Structure: Complete application with all components
5. Performance & Testing
‚úÖ Tested multiple requests by different roles
‚úÖ Verified ACL restrictions work correctly
